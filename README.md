# Time-Series-Analysis

**What is Time Series ?**
- A time series is a sequence of data being recorded at a specific time intervals.

**Where the Time Series is used ?**
- Statistics
- Econometrics
- Mathematical Finance
- Weather Forecasting
- Earthquake Prediction
- Stock Market Prediction

**What is Time Series Analysis ?**
- Analyzing the data to find pattern.

**What is Forecasting ?**
- Forecasting is the process of making predictions of the future based on past and present data and most commonly by analysis of trends.

**Factors for determining Forecasting**
- The amount of data.
- The clarity of the pattern.
- Does the forecast affect the time series ?.

**Time Series can not use if**
- The data have constant or same previous value.
- Non stationary data.

**Types of Time Series**
- **Univariate Time Series** : Only one variable is varying over time. For example, data collected from a sensor measuring the temperature of a room every second. Therefore, each second, you will only have a one-dimensional value, which is the temperature.
- **Multivariate Time Series** : Multiple variables are varying over time. For example, a tri-axial accelerometer. There are three accelerations, one for each axis (x,y,z) and they vary simultaneously over time.

**Record of TS frequency**
- Hourly
- Daily(24 hrs)
- Weekly
- Monthly
- Quarterly
- Yearly

**What is Cross Sectional Data ?**
- A type of data collected by observing many subjects at the one point or period of time.
